My name is Alvin Nguyen, this is a class lab assignment that I have been working on since Fall 2018 it is currently 2019120 and I completely redid the file structure of the lab, where the navbar is in the first layer of directories and the speakers are on the second. I added a new paged Luncheons to the website and I fixed all dead end links with construction pages.

                    Scott Sampson</h2>

                <p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the
                    Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the
                    Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the
                    ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number
                    of countries in Africa.</p>

                <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
                    University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned
                    dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid
                    horns and frills.</p>

                <p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural
                    History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New
                    York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah
                    accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
                    and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
                    interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of
                    Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p>

                <p>In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
                    work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was
                    also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book,
                    Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.</p>
